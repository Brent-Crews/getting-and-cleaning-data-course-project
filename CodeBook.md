The R script run_analysis.

R downloads raw data as a zip file, loads all necessary data into R, and processes it to create the tidy data output file tidydata.txt.



Experiments were carried out based on a group of 30 volunteers that were within an age bracket of 19-48 years, irrespective of gender. 


Each individual performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) while he/she was wearing a smartphone on his/her waist. 

Using an accelerometer and gyroscope embedded into the cellphone, both a 3-axial linear acceleration (tAcc-XYZ) and a 3-axial angular velocity (tGyro-XYZ) time domain signals were captured at a constant 50Hz rate. 


The dataset had been randomly partitioned into two disparate sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training dataset and 30% were selected for generating the test dataset.


The sensor signals were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity [tBodyAcc-XYZ, tGravityAcc-XYZ]. 


The gravitational force only has low frequency components, thus a 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency for the filter was used.



Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were calculated in order to obtain the proper Jerk signals [tBodyAccJerk-XYZ, tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ]. 

Also the magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm [tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag].



Finally, a Fast Fourier Transform was applied to certain signals [fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag]



This produced the following list of signals, where the X, the Y, and the Z of '.XYZ' is used to denote the corresponding 3-axial signal direction

•	tBodyAcx.XYZ

•	tGravityAcc.XYZ

•	tBodyAccJerk.XYZ

•	tBodyGyro.XYZ

•	tBodyGyroJerk.XYZ

•	tBodyAccMag

•	tGravityAccMag

•	tBodyAccJerkMag

•	tBodyGyroMag

•	tBodyGyroJerkMag

•	fBodyAcc.XYZ

•	fBodyAccJerk.XYZ

•	fBodyGyro.XYZ

•	fBodyAccMag

•	fBodyAccJerkMag

•	fBodyGyroMag

•	fBodyGyroJerkMag



We restricted our analysis to 2 of these variables: the signal mean and the signal standard deviation. The variables used will end in the prefix corresponding to ".mean" or ".std"
