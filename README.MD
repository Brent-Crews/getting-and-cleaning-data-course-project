#Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

The goal of this project was to download and clean a dataset on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones, then process the data, and lastly output the data into an easily readible tidy dataset.


A description of the raw data used in the project can be found within the following link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


Also, the actual raw data can be re-downloaded as a zip file from within the following link:

This repo contains four files:

** **README.md**: This file.

** [**tidydata.txt**](https://github.com/Brent-Crews/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project/blob/master/tidydata.txt): The final tidy dataset - this is the project output.

** [**CodeBook.md**](https://github.com/Brent-Crews/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project/blob/master/CodeBook.md): A codebook describing the variables in the final dataset, the source of the data, basic details of the study design, and details of how the data were processed.

** [**run_analysis.R**](https://github.com/Brent-Crews/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project/blob/master/run_analysis.R): An R script which performs all steps to download and process the raw data to produce the final tidy dataset.


Follow the instructions in the CodeBook.md file (https://github.com/Brent-Crews/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project/blob/master/CodeBook.md) to reproduce the results from this exercise.
